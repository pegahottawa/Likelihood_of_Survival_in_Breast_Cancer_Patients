 Above Python codes are provided to show the use of Machine Learning to predict the likelihood of survival in breast cancer patients using gene expression profiling. Machine learning techniques, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and different feature selection techniques such as Lasso and recursive feature elimination are used for finding an important genes or features that have an essential role in predictivity of the model. Therefore, the python codes describes the evaluation of different Machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer tumors into two groups of high and low survival.
